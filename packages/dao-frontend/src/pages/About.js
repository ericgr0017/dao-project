                  A <strong>Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)</strong> is a community-led entity with no central authority. 
                  It's fully autonomous and transparent, governed by its members who collectively make decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike traditional organizations with hierarchical management, DAOs operate using smart contracts‚Äî
                  self-executing code that automatically implements decisions when predetermined conditions are met.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Think of a DAO as a digital community with a shared bank account and rulebook, where everyone has a say in how resources are used.

                  <strong>Humanity DAO</strong> was created to address the most pressing challenges facing our species. 
                  Traditional institutions often struggle with bureaucracy, short-term thinking, and misaligned incentives.

                <p>
                  We believe that by harnessing collective intelligence and resources through decentralized governance, 
                  we can develop more effective, transparent, and innovative solutions to global problems.

                    If you don't already have one, you'll need to set up a digital wallet. We recommend MetaMask, 
                    which is free and easy to use.

                <h3>Do I need to know about blockchain to participate?</h3>
                <p>
                  No, we've designed Humanity DAO to be accessible to everyone. While understanding blockchain 
                  can be helpful, our interface is user-friendly and doesn't require technical knowledge.
                </p>

                <h3>Is there a cost to join?</h3>
                <p>
                  There's no membership fee, but you will need a small amount of cryptocurrency (ETH) to pay for 
                  transaction fees when voting or creating proposals. New members receive a small allocation of 
                  governance tokens to get started.

                <h3>How are funds managed and distributed?</h3>
                <p>
                  All funds are held in a transparent treasury controlled by smart contracts. Funds can only be 
                  distributed when a proposal passes the required voting threshold. Every transaction is recorded 
                  on the blockchain and visible to all members.

                <h3>How do I earn more governance tokens?</h3>
                <p>
                  You can earn additional governance tokens by contributing meaningfully to the DAO. This includes 
                  creating successful proposals, participating in governance, and helping implement approved projects.

                <h3>What if I don't have technical skills to offer?</h3>
                <p>
                  Humanity DAO needs all kinds of skills and perspectives! You can contribute through research, 
                  communication, community building, proposal evaluation, and many other non-technical ways.

                <h3>Can I participate without a digital wallet?</h3>
                <p>
                  Yes! While a wallet is required for voting and creating proposals, you can still explore the platform, 
                  join community discussions, contribute skills to projects, and submit ideas through our public channels.

                <h3>Is my personal information secure?</h3>
                <p>
                  We prioritize privacy and security. Your wallet address is visible on the blockchain, but you 
                  control how much personal information you share with the community. We never ask for or store 
                  your private keys or recovery phrases.
