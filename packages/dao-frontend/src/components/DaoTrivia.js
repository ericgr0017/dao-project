    {
      question: "What does DAO stand for?",
      options: [
        "Digital Asset Organization",
        "Decentralized Autonomous Organization",
        "Distributed Application Ownership",
        "Digital Authority Organization"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government."
    },
    {
      question: "Which of these is NOT typically a characteristic of a DAO?",
      options: [
        "Decentralized governance",
        "Centralized leadership",
        "Token-based voting",
        "Transparent operations"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "DAOs are characterized by decentralized governance, token-based voting, and transparent operations. Centralized leadership goes against the core principles of a DAO."
    },
    {
      question: "What technology typically underpins most DAOs?",
      options: [
        "Cloud computing",
        "Artificial intelligence",
        "Blockchain",
        "Quantum computing"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Blockchain technology underpins most DAOs, providing the decentralized, transparent, and immutable infrastructure necessary for their operation."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the primary purpose of governance tokens in a DAO?",
      options: [
        "To pay transaction fees",
        "To vote on proposals",
        "To encrypt messages",
        "To mine new blocks"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Governance tokens in a DAO primarily allow holders to vote on proposals, giving them a say in the decision-making process proportional to their token holdings."
    },
    {
      question: "Which of these is a common challenge faced by DAOs?",
      options: [
        "Too much centralization",
        "Low transaction costs",
        "Voter apathy",
        "Excessive regulation"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Voter apathy is a common challenge in DAOs, where members may not participate in governance decisions, leading to low voter turnout and potentially unrepresentative decision-making."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a 'proposal' in the context of a DAO?",
      options: [
        "A marketing document",
        "A suggested change or action for the DAO to consider",
        "A technical whitepaper",
        "A financial statement"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "In a DAO, a proposal is a suggested change or action that members can vote on, potentially affecting the organization's operations, treasury, or governance."
    },
    {
      question: "What is 'quadratic voting' in DAOs?",
      options: [
        "Voting where each member gets exactly 4 votes",
        "Voting where the cost of each additional vote increases quadratically",
        "Voting that requires a quorum of at least 4%",
        "Voting that happens every 4 weeks"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Quadratic voting is a system where the cost of each additional vote increases quadratically, making it more expensive to cast multiple votes on the same proposal, which helps prevent wealthy members from dominating decisions."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a 'multisig wallet' often used for in DAOs?",
      options: [
        "Mining cryptocurrency",
        "Storing member information",
        "Managing treasury funds securely",
        "Encrypting communications"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Multisig (multi-signature) wallets are often used in DAOs to manage treasury funds securely, requiring multiple authorized signatures to approve transactions, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized spending."
    },
    {
      question: "What is 'token-weighted voting'?",
      options: [
        "Voting where tokens are physically weighed",
        "Voting where your influence is proportional to your token holdings",
        "Voting where token holders must stake their tokens",
        "Voting where tokens are burned after voting"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Token-weighted voting is a system where a member's voting power is proportional to the number of tokens they hold, giving those with more tokens greater influence over decisions."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a common criticism of token-weighted voting in DAOs?",
      options: [
        "It's too complicated to implement",
        "It can lead to plutocracy where wealthy members have more influence",
        "It requires too much computational power",
        "It makes voting too frequent"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A common criticism of token-weighted voting is that it can lead to plutocracy, where members with more tokens (often the wealthy) have disproportionate influence over decisions, potentially undermining the democratic ideals of DAOs."
